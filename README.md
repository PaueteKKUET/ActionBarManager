# ActionBarManager
A simple manager to enqueue action bars for Spigot users.

**The plugin is currently under development**. It allows other plugins to use a simple 
queue system for action bars, using different parameters, such as priorities, for select 
the best candidate for each player.

More information will be added in the future.
